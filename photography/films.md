<em>[Kodak Portra 160](http://mortendahl.dk/blog/tag/kodak-portra-160/)</em>:
Favourite general-purpose colour film so far, giving saturated but natural colours. At a reasonable price, this is not only the film that I always keep an extra one of in my bag, but also the one I make sure to have in one of the two cameras I typically bring. Shoot at indicated exposure, but generally very forgiving film -- can easily be underexposed and overexposed by one stop.</li>

<em>[Kodak Portra 400](http://mortendahl.dk/blog/tag/kodak-portra-400/)</em>:
can't tell the difference between this one and the 160, except that it's slightly more expensive. I use it with my slower zoom lens.</li>

<em>Fujifilm Superia 200</em>:
Could work as a general-purpose film as well, although I find it particular suited for nature scenes with greens and browns. Pretty forgiving, perhaps a bit less than the Portra. Shoot at indicated exposure.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<em>Fujifilm FujiChrome Velvia 50 (in E6)</em>:
Expensive film, both buying and developing. Not particularly remarkable for everyday shots (not worth the price really) but exceptional blues and greens and, I suspect, nature or richly coloured scenes. Shoot at ISO 50 or a tad slower, does not underexpose very well but can handle a bit of overexposure.</li>

Kodak Ektar 100:</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<em>Lomography X-Pro Slide 200 (in C41)</em>:
Great contrasty film when you get the exposure right, with a skew in colours turning some muted and others vivid (especially reds and oranges) with a nice rendition of for instance skin tones. Exposure must be pretty accurate though, as it does not underexpose nor overexpose well (leaves a purple tint in both cases).</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<em>Lomography Redscale XR 50-200</em>:
Funny look well-suited for summer. Colours range from all red when underexposed, shoot at ISO 50.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<em>Lomography LomoChrome Purple XR 100-400</em>:
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<em>AgfaPhoto CT Precisa 100 (in C41, i.e. cross-processed)</em>:
Very high contrast when cross-processed from what I've seen so far, to the point where it's hard to handle predictably. Gives a citrus colour tint that I'm not particular fond of. When you get it right it can produce very nice shots, but a similar style is more easily obtained with the Lomography X-Pro Slide.</li>
